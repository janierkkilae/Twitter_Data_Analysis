TWITTER DATA ANALYSIS (based on historic data)

You can generate a .csv at Twitter Analytics (Export Data) and then feed it in the Python code to get a couple of performance metrics:
  - At what time you tend to tweet?
  - At what time tweets do better than usually?
  - Averages for Tweets
  - Should you use a visual?
  - Does tweet length matter?
  - What are the most used hashtags?

This is my first code, which I used to compute social media analytics at my company.
